Create some kind of adapter in order to make use of two distinct interfaces.
in our example we have "EnemyTank" & "EnemyRobot".
Both have different methods.
The "IEnemyAttacker" interface defines the attack methods.
So, in order to make "EnemyRobot" to work with our interface we'll create an adapter class "EnemyRocotAdapter". This class must implement the "IEnemyAttacker" interface.
Next, implement the interface inside the "EnemyRobotAdapter" class and use "EnemyRobot" object to call the methods.
