In Factory pattern, we create the object without exposing the creation logic. 
In this pattern, an interface is used for creating an object, but let subclass decide which class to instantiate. The creation of object is done when it is required. 


In short, factory method design pattern abstract the process of object creation and allows the object to be created at run-time when it is required.
